# Reference TCAD regression tests

This directory contains Python regression tests for checked-in cross-TCAD
fixtures, import/conversion tools, comparison scripts, and validation report
contracts.  Device-level reusable inputs live under `reference_tcad/`; the
repository no longer ships a separate set of uncalibrated engineering example
decks.

Run the main reference-tool checks from the repository root:

```bash
python -m unittest tests.regression.test_reference_tcad_tools
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R reference_tcad_regression
```

Many reference cases have additional focused test modules in this directory.
Each case README or machine-readable `*_reference.json` inventory identifies
its authoritative scripts, reports, and acceptance boundary.

Generated TDR, VTK, accepted-state, and log files remain under ignored
`build*/reference_tcad/` directories.  Tests should use checked-in neutral
inputs or explicitly generated temporary fixtures and must not present
synthetic smoke data as commercial-tool calibration evidence.

The retired custom NMOS, coarse7x3, Minimal6, and skewed-Tri3 reference cases
are no longer regression inputs. Import/contact and mesh invariants remain
covered using temporary data and retained fixtures. Shared avalanche helper
tests are `test_sentaurus_avalanche_replay.py` and
`test_sentaurus_avalanche_controls.py`; the standalone contact override test
is `test_sentaurus_contact_overrides.py`.
