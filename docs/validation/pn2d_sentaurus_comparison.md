# pn2d Sentaurus Comparison

The `reference_tcad/pn2d` case is a 2-D abrupt PN diode imported from
Sentaurus. The structure is `L=2.0 um`, `H=0.5 um`, with junction position
`Xj=1.0 um`, `Na=Nd=1e17 cm^-3`, an `Anode` contact on the left boundary, and
a `Cathode` contact on the right boundary.

The import path preserves the Sentaurus TDR mesh, contacts, material regions,
reference IV/BV curves, command summaries, and full `doping.csv` node-level
donor/acceptor table. Generated faithful Vela decks keep `node_doping_file:
"doping.csv"` so the exact imported doping is available for solver
development and regression inspection.

The current executable comparison uses the faithful node-level doping decks.
The IV deck uses `vela_step: 0.1` so the local gate compares 11 finite Vela
points against the Sentaurus IV reference. The BV deck uses Vela's Selberherr
impact-ionization diagnostic in place of Sentaurus `Avalanche(OkutoCrowell)`.
These reports are diagnostic-only and do not yet require trend match.

Vela currently treats Sentaurus Fermi statistics as Boltzmann carrier
statistics. Sentaurus Okuto-Crowell avalanche is approximated by Vela
Selberherr impact ionization for BV diagnostics. These reports establish a
readable, runnable, finite, and comparable regression loop; they are not yet a
calibrated numerical match to Sentaurus.

## Hybrid Solver Status

Faithful pn2d decks now use `solver.method: "gummel_newton"` and preserve
`node_doping_file: "doping.csv"`. Each faithful bias point is configured to run
Gummel first and attempt coupled Newton with `warm_start=true`. For the current
pn2d gate, Newton handoff is diagnostic: if Newton rejects the first step, the
finite Gummel state is accepted with `handoff.fallback:
"gummel_on_newton_failure"`.

The old region-average `runtime_doping_scale` path is no longer required for
pn2d. It remains available through an opt-in `runtime_diagnostic` config block
for future debugging, but the default bundled pn2d reference runs the imported
node-level doping. Current gate:

- faithful IV/BV deck generation is required;
- faithful decks must preserve node-level doping and hybrid handoff settings;
- faithful IV/BV execution must remain finite;
- strict Sentaurus numerical agreement is not yet required.

Useful local verification command:

```powershell
